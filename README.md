<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About Jesvi Bot

[![Jesvi Bot Utility][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

This project was started as a program to handle my telegram groups that had a large number of members & also to serve several other unique features that were made simple using Jesvi Bot to the users.

Here's some shallow information :
* Comes with tones of usefull bot modules that can be fully customized & used for efficient management 
* Has cross-platform support across major platforms
* Comes with a utility application for setting up the requirements, tweaking the configurations & to access other functionalities across respective platform
* Simple & easy Database setup for both servers & personal computers
* Debugging & live status info are quick and feasible
* And lots more features that I didn't mention

This project still being developing by the me & community, So you can expect more features and updates quite often..

All the tools are packed in & the Jesvi Bot is all set to go in a server via script mode & also in a PC via utility mode which proves to be a good feature for debugging & for running mainstream
